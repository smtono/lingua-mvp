# Setup

Welcome and thank you for trying Lingua MVP!

This is an experimental build of a potential language learning app that is specifically tailored for the best user experience.

The current functionality of this experimental build includes:

- Running scripts for creating different user contexts
- Testing quiz functionality generated by contexts

## Initial Setup

Currently, the functionality of Lingua is all done through its command line interface (CLI).
